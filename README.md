# Flappy Bird AI

A flappy bird game played by an AI.  
The aim is to train an AI to perfectly play flappy bird with the NEAT algorithm.

This project is written entirely in Python, using the pygame module for the game and my own implementation of NEAT to produce and evolve networks.  
More info about the NEAT implementation I used described [here](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.cec02.pdf)
